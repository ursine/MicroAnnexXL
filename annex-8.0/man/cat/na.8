          The Annex network administrator program, _n_a, is a utility
          that can restart an Annex terminal server, reset its ports,
          and display or change most of its operating characteristics.
          One _n_a command can examine or change the parameters for one
          or more of the serial ports or the printer port on a single
          Annex or several Annexes.

          Only the super-user can change configuration, reset ports,
          or restart an Annex terminal server.

          Some of _n_a's more typical actions can be performed with the
          _m_o_d_t_t_y subcommand of the _s_y_s_a_d_m(1) command.

          The _n_a utility, including all commands and their arguments,
          is described in detail in the _A_n_n_e_x _N_e_t_w_o_r_k _A_d_m_i_n_i_s_t_r_a_t_o_r'_s
