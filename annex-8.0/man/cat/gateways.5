          When an Annex boots, it reads the ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss section of the
          ccccoooonnnnffffiiiigggg....aaaannnnnnnneeeexxxx file from ////uuuussssrrrr////ssssppppoooooooollll////eeeerrrrppppccccdddd////bbbbffffssss....  This file
          contains commands to initialize the routing tables of all
          Annexes on the local network.  Finally, it can be used to
          add host names to an annex's host name table.

          For routing information, the Annex ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss category has a
          format that corresponds closely to the ////eeeettttcccc////ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss file
          used by _r_o_u_t_e_d(1M).  That is, you can prep the Annex routing
          table with routes for networks and hosts.  However, a few
          differences exist.  The basic entry has the format:
9               {nnnneeeetttt|hhhhoooosssstttt} _a_d_d_r_1 ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyy _a_d_d_r_2 mmmmeeeettttrrrriiiicccc _v_a_l_u_e
               {ppppaaaassssssssiiiivvvveeee|hhhhaaaarrrrddddwwwwiiiirrrreeeedddd}

          The keywords nnnneeeetttt and hhhhoooosssstttt indicate whether the Internet
          address _a_d_d_r_1 specifies a destination network or host. The
          Internet address _a_d_d_r_2 specifies the gateway via which the
          destination is reached.

          Since the RIP implementation on an Annex is listen-only and
          does not exchange any routing information with other
          routers, the Annex does not have the notion of active
          gateways.  Thus, aaaaccccttttiiiivvvveeee routes are not supported in the
          Annex ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss file.  However, a route learned from an
          active gateway producing RIP broadcasts will be aged.  Thus,
          if that gateway stops including a route in its routing
          updates, the route will eventually be discarded.

          The Annex does support passive gateways, and the keyword
          ppppaaaassssssssiiiivvvveeee marks a route as such.  This indicates that the
          gateway does not generate its own routing information.  The
          principal effect of a ppppaaaassssssssiiiivvvveeee route is to keep a routing
          entry from being aged and ultimately discarded.  However,
          such a route can be overridden by a routing update
          containing a better route to the destination.  The Annex
          also supports the notion of hhhhaaaarrrrddddwwwwiiiirrrreeeedddd (or _f_i_x_e_d) routes,
          marked by the keyword hhhhaaaarrrrddddwwwwiiiirrrreeeedddd.  Such a route will never be
          changed or deleted, even if a routing update containing a
          better route is received by the Annex.

          Finally, the metric _v_a_l_u_e indicates the number of hops
          needed to reach the destination.

          There are a few additional differences between the Annex
          ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss category and the ////eeeettttcccc////ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss file used by
          _r_o_u_t_e_d(1M).  First, all Internet addresses in the Annex
          ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss file are required to be specified in standard
          Internet dot notation.  This is because when the Annex is

     GGGGAAAATTTTEEEEWWWWAAAAYYYYSSSS((((4444))))                   AAAANNNNNNNNEEEEXXXX                   GGGGAAAATTTTEEEEWWWWAAAAYYYYSSSS((((4444))))



          reading the gateways file, it is still in the process of
          booting, and thus cannot yet do name-to-address
          translations.  Comments can be placed in the ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss
          section and are introduced by a ``#'' character anywhere on
          a line and terminated by the end of that line.  Excess white
          space in the file is ignored.

          If an Annex has syslogging enabled, it will report errors
          encountered while reading the ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss section with an
          extensive selection of syslog messages.  The messages are
          self-descriptive and include the line number of the
          offending line.  Various information useful for only for
          debugging is logged at the the _i_n_f_o and _d_e_b_u_g levels.

          In addition to routing information, there are two other
          types of entries possible in the ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyyssss category.  The
          first is the conditional:
9               aaaannnnnnnneeeexxxx _i_p_a_d_d_r
                ...
               eeeellllsssseeee
                ...
               eeeennnndddd

          The ellipses represent any group of entries normally valid
          in the gateways file.  This conditional causes all the
          entries in the first set of ellipses to be evaluated only on
          the Annex that uses the given Internet address _i_p_a_d_d_r for
          its Ethernet interface.  The optional eeeellllsssseeee clause causes all
          the entries in the second set of ellipses to be evaluated on
          all Annexes, except for the Annex that matched the aaaannnnnnnneeeexxxx
          clause.  This can be used to selectively assign routes to
          hosts, such as only giving a default route to an external
          gateway to certain Annexes.

          The second additional entry is used for adding host name
          entries to the host table of an annex.  The entries are
          similar to entries in the ////eeeettttcccc////hhhhoooosssstttt file, except aliasing is
          not supported.  When the Annex boots, it adds the host name
          entries in the ggggaaaatttteeeewwwwaaaayyyy section of the configuration file to
          its host table.  The format of a host name entry is the
          Internet Address of the host followed by the host name. For
          example:
9               192.9.200.2 snoopy

          Host name entries may be conditional with the use of the
          aaaannnnnnnneeeexxxx and eeeennnndddd statements.  This restricts the loading of the
          host names to particular annexes.

          The following is an example:

               annex 132.245.10.7

               These entries inform _a_n_n_e_x_0_1, ipaddr 132.245.10.7, that

               132.245.5 and informs other Annexes on network
               132.245.10 that _a_n_n_e_x_0_1 is a gateway to either _h_o_s_t_0_1
               or network 132.245.5.
