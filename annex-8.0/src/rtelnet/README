		RTELNET (Reverse Telnet)

Rtelnet is a modified version of the Berkeley telnetd program. Its
purpose is to create a pseudo-tty device that is connected to an
Annex serial port. This allows UNIX programs such as tip and uucp to
access serial devices attached to Annex ports. Rtelnet works like
a telnet daemon program (telnetd) except in a reverse fashion. Instead
of accepting telnet connections from other network machines, rtelnet
makes telnet connections to Annex ports. Rtelnet creates a new file-like
device (usually in /dev) that programs can open and use like
a normal /dev/tty.

Rtelnet will run as-is on any 4.2/4.3 BSD system or SUN workstation.
To run on other systems may require some code modification.


Syntax:

rtelnet [-<switches>] <annex> <port> <device name>

where,
	switches - can be 'm' and/or 'r'

	annex - is the Inet address or hostname of the Annex

	port - is the Annex port number

	device name - is the file name to be created


switches:

	r - means remove <device name> if it exists. The default is
		to print an error message and exit.

	m - means to momentarily drop the network connection to the
		Annex port whenever the pseudo device is closed.
		This can be used to cause a dial-out modem to
		hangup when a program like tip exits.



Example usage:

	You have a dial-out modem attached to port 15 of an Annex
	named "modem-annex". You would like users on a SUN workstation
	to be able to use the modem via 'tip'.


1. Configure Annex port 15 using 'NA' to "control_lines: modem_control"

2. Add an entry to /etc/rc script to create the tip pseudo-device whenever
	the SUN is booted. Entry would be:

	rtelnet -rm modem-annex 15 /dev/modem1

3. Create new system definition in /etc/remote specifying /dev/modem1
	as the tip (tv) device.
