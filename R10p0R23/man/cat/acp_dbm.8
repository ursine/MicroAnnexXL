          ----ssss _u_s_e_r      This option sends to stdout information about
                      that user stored in the apc_dbm database.
                      First it outputs the following line:

                      Number of failed logins since last success: N

                      then it outputs a list of the previous login
                      failures, up to 20, the ultimate maximum of
                      login failures that can be stored.  The format
                      of each failure:

                      Login failure on Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973.

          ----cccc _u_s_e_r      This option clears the user from the blacklist
                      and clears the history of login failures as
                      well.  Use this option to remove a user from the
                      blacklist.  Make sure you have investigated this
                      account and are confident it is not under
                      attack.  This option only clears the blaclist
                      login failure logs; it does not clear the
                      password history or any other user information
                      stored in the acp_dbm database.

          ----dddd _u_s_e_r      This option deletes the user record from the
                      acp_dbm database.  Use this option when you wish
                      to delete a user entirely.  Note that you will
                      still have to delete references to the user in
                      any ACP files(i.e. acp_passwd, acp_userinfo,
                      etc.); this option will only delete the user
                      from acp_dbm.

          ----llll           This option lists all usernames stored in the
                      acp_dbm.

          _a_c_p__d_b_m is the Annex database services daemon.  It supports
          the use of blacklisting features which is, the authorization
          of users based on their previous login history.  The
          blacklisting can be achieved in two ways.  One way is to set
          the maximum number of consecutive failures and the other way
          is to set the number of total allowable login failures over
          a certain period of time.

          The utility always displays the current list of blacklisted
          users apart from the options specified on the command line.
