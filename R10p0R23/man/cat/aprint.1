          ----AAAA _a_n_n_e_x     The host name string or Internet address (in
                      standard Internet dot-separated notation) of the
                      Annex on which to print.

          ----LLLL _l_i_n_e      The serial port line number to use for printing
                      on the Annex specified by ----AAAA.  If neither this
                      option nor the ----pppp option are specified, or if a
                      value of 0 is given as the line number, then the
                      parallel port is used.  A value greater than
                      zero specifies a serial port.  This option
                      cannot be used at the same time as the ----pppp
                      option.

          ----pppp _p_o_r_t      The parallel port line number to use for
                      printing on the Annex specified by ----AAAA.  This
                      option cannot be used with the ----LLLL option.

          ----ffff           Prevent _a_p_r_i_n_t from supplying extra form-feeds.

          ----DDDD           Specifies that debug output should be sent to
                      standard output. This option may be repeated for
                      more detailed information. Level 1: Connect
                      acknowledge and per file messages. Level 2:

          ----FFFF _s_t_r_i_n_g    Use _s_t_r_i_n_g to produce a form-feed instead of
                      the default string of a single ^^^^LLLL.  This will
                      override an ffffffff==== capability read from
                      /_e_t_c/_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p.  No form-feeds are produced if
                      the ----ffff flag has been given.

          ffffiiiilllleeeessss...    The file(s) to print; if none are specified,
                      then the standard input is used.

          The _a_p_r_i_n_t utility is intended for sites that either do not
          have or cannot modify the Berkeley printer spooler.  It
          sends files directly to a printer attached to an Annex,
          without the use of a spooling mechanism.  _A_p_r_i_n_t supports
          printers connected to either a parallel port or any of an

          Annex's serial ports.  The name of the Annex and port to be
          printed on are specified by the ----AAAA and ----LLLL arguments,
          respectively.  To be backward-compatible with old versions
          of _a_p_r_i_n_t, it also supports a ----PPPP argument specifying a
          printer name to be looked up in the /_e_t_c/_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p file.  The
          ----AAAA and ----PPPP arguments are mutually exclusive.  If neither is
          given, _a_p_r_i_n_t will look up in /_e_t_c/_p_r_i_n_t_c_a_p the printer
          named by either the value of the PRINTER environment
          variable or, if that is not set, the default printer named
          _l_p.

          By default, _a_p_r_i_n_t will print a form-feed at the start of
          every file and at the end of all specified files.  Versions
          of the Annex operational code previous to R3.0 produced
          these form-feeds without a means of disabling them.  Since
          this function should now be produced by host resident
          software, _a_p_r_i_n_t will provide them for backward
          compatibility.  The ----ffff flag will prevent _a_p_r_i_n_t from
          generating these form-feeds.

          Some ports of the Berkeley networking software to System V
          systems do not support out-of-band data (MSG_OOB) on
          sockets.  Since OOB is used in the close handshake of the
          Annex LPD protocol, this handshake will not be used on such
          hosts.  The implication of this is that with two back-to-
          back invocations of _a_p_r_i_n_t , the second can fail because the
          Annex port will still be busy from the first print job.
          This should not be a problem if _a_p_r_i_n_t is invoked from
          within a spooling system (such as System V lp or Berkeley
          LPD).

          Revision R7.0 and later of _a_p_r_i_n_t cannot be used with Annex
          operational code before revision R3.0, because the later
          Annex operational code revisions use a more elaborate Annex
          LPD protocol that provides for acknowledgements from the
          Annex to the host (indicating that the Annex is ready to
          receive data) and from the host to the Annex (marking EOF,
          among other things).  This makes it possible for _a_p_r_i_n_t to
          determine that the Annex has opened the requested serial or
          parallel line sucessfully.
