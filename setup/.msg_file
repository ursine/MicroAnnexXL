#
# This file contains some of the messages that get printed by the
# installation script.  They are placed here for several reasons:
#     1) The same message is printed out in different places.
#     2) To make code reading in the main installation script easier.
#     3) To allow easier updating of messages easier.
#
# The file is used by the installation script by code similar to the
# following (which should show why this is a help in code reading):
#	case "$ans" in
#		"?")
#			msgid=xyz
#			. $MSG_FILE
#			;;
#	esac
#
# Most messages are printed using "here documents" ( cat << LABEL --- LABEL)
# This allows easy modification because quotes do not have to be matched.
#
# The case statement is mainly used for printing messages but there may
# actually be a few cases where other code gets executed (such as removing
# files, assigning variables and such).  This should not be done lightly.
# One case that could be considered valid is putting code here that would be
# called more than once (simulating a shell function).  The main code should
# note well what is happening if it does that.
#
# Also note that some of the messages may be expected to be written to
# a file and that the filename is expected to be set with
# msgfile="name_of_file" before assigning "msgid".  The first line of the
# "here document" would look like "cat << LABEL > $msgfile" in this case.
#
#############################################################################
#
# Possible Enhancement: Seek out "no_msg_avail=true" and add messages
#			where helpful. Some of these places are candidates
#			for extra messages but not all are.
#                       
#


# A number of cases can print out redundant information.  For them we set
# some flags and then at the end of the case statement we print messages
# if the flags are set.  Always clear these flags first.

Normally you should never be able to see this message because it was
determined that you are not the superuser ("root") and the installation
ended.  However, you have set an environment variable that is allowing
you to continue.

If you really are root then you will be able to continue with the installation.

If you are not root and you did not expect to see this message then you
should normally quit.  If you continue then there may be errors that
prevent a correct installation.

If your platform is not one of the ones listed then you may attempt to

Choices 1 and 2)
   The $Box software distribution may be on a tape, a collection of $floppies
   or a CD-ROM.  If it is on $floppies or a tape please indicate here. You
   will be asked for the name of the drive holding the distribution tarfile.

Choice 3)
   Less likely is that the distribution is on a tarfile.  The software
   distribution on a tape or a CD-ROM contains a tarfile.  This tarfile could
   be copied onto a hard disk and also used as a distribution medium.  You
   will be asked for the name of the file.

Choice 4)
   The installation program can also be run after all files have been
   extracted from the medium, in which case no further extraction is needed.
   For example, a complete tape distribution was extracted by the tar command
   prior to calling the install script.

            $package Software Installation Script

This installation shell script will examine your system and possibly
ask you questions to generate the needed configuration to allow you
to compile the $Box host utilities.

You can abort the script at any time and restart it without any 
ill effects.  Once install-$box completes the configuration section,
you will only need to use

         "make all"    and    "make install"

from the "src" directory to later re-build or re-install the utilities.

At any question prompt you can escape to a shell by typing "!".
When you exit that shell you will bounce back to the question prompt.
Many of the questions will have default answers in square brackets;
typing carriage return will give you the default.

To do this, shutdown any running erpcd process and then move the file

Next, restart the erpcd process by calling the new version of erpcd.
